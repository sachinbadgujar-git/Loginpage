   - Defines the structure of the login form, including fields for username and password.
   - Includes basic placeholders and labels for accessibility.

2. **CSS (`styles.css`)**:
   - Styles the login form with a modern and clean design.
   - Ensures the form is responsive and visually appealing.

3. **JavaScript (`script.js`)**:
   - Handles interactive elements, such as validating the input fields before form submission.
   - Can be extended to handle API calls for authentication.
